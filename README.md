### Emotion Recognition For Psychologists: 

* Helps you quickly understand a patient’s current emotional state (e.g., anger, sadness, anxiety, joy) during sessions.
* Supports early detection of emotional changes that may signal risk, relapse, or improvement.
* Provides objective cues (from face, voice, or behavior) to complement your clinical judgment, not replace it.
